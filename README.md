I am a student at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology,Sylhet, Bangladesh, in the Department of Forestry and Environmental Science. My research interests include remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and environmental modeling. More specifically, I am interested in studying forest and environmental change using geographic big data, machine learning, and cloud computing (e.g., Google Earth Engine).
